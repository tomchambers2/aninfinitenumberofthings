========================

This page generates an infinite number of pseudo life goals using a markov chain algorithm. It picks a sequence of words based on what is statistically likely to occur. Sometimes it will be nonsense, sometimes it will be amusing. It will rarely be less specific and meaningful than the real goals they are based on.

You can see it live at aninfinitenumberofthings.com

In order to contribute some things, go to scripts/things.txt and add a new line for each life goal you want to add. If you spend a bit of time reading the generated things, you might see patterns that make some source goals into more amusing outputs than others.
